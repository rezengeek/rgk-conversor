# RGK Conversor Online - Online Converter
This project arose from the principle "Solve real user problems" "Think like a real user". Basically, I have always faced problems converting an audio file in a simple way, in every online tool there is a way to earn money, whether it is subscriptions or advertisements. 

My problem has always been with sites that have a million ads, and you click on everything and it redirects you to a thousand different sites. This creates immense difficulty in converting a file, these sites download unwanted files, installers, and even viruses. So thinking as a user who faces these problems, and I know many others do too and would like to create their own solution. So, I decided to create my own audio conversion tool, initially converting from WAV to MP3, and MP3 to WAV. 

This is the (BETA version) of this tool, improvements will come, and new tools, transforming this project into something that is not limited to just one tool, but several tools in one place. All this free, without millions of ads, without viruses, without downloading unwanted files.



# System Features

This is the current main Index interface of the project (MP3 to WAV Converter). It is the same interface as the MP3 to WAV link. Soon, the Index.html link will have a unique interface, with widgets that redirect to the tools contained on the site
